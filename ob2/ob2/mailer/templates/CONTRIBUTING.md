Some tips about writing new email templates:

- You need both a text version and an HTML version
- Text emails should be limited to 75 columns (or 80 columns). Anything reasonable is ok.

Some more tips:

- Many email clients show the first 15-20 words of an email as a "preview". Make good use of the preview text! (For transactional emails, it's a good idea to put something there that will vary.)
- You can use markdown-style formatting for text emails, or whatever looks good.
- Be aware of variable-length interpolated strings (student names, assignment names, etc) when considering line length.
- Write verbosely, be friendly, and check your spelling/grammar. Your students will appreciate it!
